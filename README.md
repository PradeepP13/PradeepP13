### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Pradeep, a student pursuing an MBA in Business Intelligence at the National Forensic Sciences University. I'm passionate about using data to drive business decisions and help organizations achieve their goals. I have experience using SQL and Python for data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. I'm currently expanding my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, and am excited to apply what I've learned to real-world problems. Please take a moment to explore my projects and feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
